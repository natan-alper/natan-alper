- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Natan Alper and I am upbeat, determined and a quick learner. I am looking to have an impact in the tech realm, whether that be in a software developer, analyst or cloud related career.
- ðŸ‘€ Some of my interests are playing basketball, exercising, and learning tiktok dance routines. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to master the commonly used machine learning libraries in Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib) as well as HTML, CSS, Javascript and Java. I am also looking to be a solutions architect as I am studying for the AWS Solutions Architect certification (I've obtained the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification).
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out and introduce yourself on LinkedIn :)
